<h3>Not a Simple BBCode Parser</h3>

There are a lot of BBCode parsers out there, but many of them are simple -- too simple. While simple may be okay in certain circumstances, it isn't good enough when it comes to BBCode.<br>
<br>
Most of those BBCode parsers do simple string replaces (replace <code>[b]</code> and <code>[/b]</code> with <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/strong&gt;</code>) which can lead to unclosed tags which can then break your layout, or simply generate invalid XHTML.<br>
<br>
SpeedyBBC is not like that because it generates compliant XHTML and closes any and all open tags.<br>
